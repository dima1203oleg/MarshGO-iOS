# MARSHGO iOS app

MARSHGO has a Capacitor iOS target that packages the existing React app in a native WKWebView. It uses bundle ID `ua.marshgo.app`, iOS 15 or later, the MARSHGO app icon, and portrait layout. The mobile-first home/search/trips/chat/profile shell follows the supplied reference. The welcome screen uses a bundled Carpathian road image, a transparent status bar with light icons, and five-control bottom navigation. Vehicle CRUD, offer booking, passenger demand, driver publishing and proposal negotiation use the current API. Driver foreground navigation now requests a real GPS fix and server-computed road route, resumes an active session, streams validated foreground fixes, and deletes precise position data when ended. Passive matching, turn instructions, rerouting, tile-provider setup, background GPS, and physical-device permission verification remain incomplete.

## Build and run on a simulator

Requirements: macOS, Xcode, Bun (the repository package manager), and an available iOS Simulator. The API must use a local development OTP adapter; the application must not use live SMS credentials during simulator testing.

```sh
docker compose up -d db redis
DATABASE_URL=postgres://marshgo:local_only_change_me@127.0.0.1:5434/marshgo bun run db:migrate
DATABASE_URL=postgres://marshgo:local_only_change_me@127.0.0.1:5434/marshgo \
NODE_ENV=development AUTH_DEV_OTP=true API_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
CORS_ORIGINS=capacitor://localhost,http://localhost:3000 \
SESSION_SECRET=local-simulator-only-secret bun run api
```

In another terminal, provide a simulator UDID from `xcrun simctl list devices available`:

```sh
SIMULATOR_UDID=<device-udid> bun run ios:simulator
```

The simulator build points at `http://localhost:3002`. The iOS target permits cleartext HTTP only for the `localhost` hostname for local development. Release builds must set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the HTTPS API origin; do not ship the simulator endpoint or local development OTP configuration.

The production welcome and authenticated mobile screens are built from the same React/Capacitor app. Site revision `7a5540b` was cloned from the published `MarshGO-Site` main, rebuilt into the native shell, compiled with Xcode, and installed/launched on iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPhone 16 Pro Max simulators. Final screenshots `/tmp/marshgo-site7a5540b-iphone15-retry.png` and `/tmp/marshgo-site7a5540b-iphone16-final.png` show the road background, brand lockup, Ukrainian copy, CTA hierarchy, and safe-area layout on both screen sizes. WebKit sometimes produced an all-white early capture; terminating/relaunching the app and waiting for first paint yielded the complete welcome screen on both simulators. The latest site change also refreshes the foreground driver's candidate list when the passenger confirms mutual route-match interest; that interaction is covered by API/Redis integration, not simulator gestures. The previous map retry screenshots are `/tmp/marshgo-iphone15-map-retry.png` and `/tmp/marshgo-iphone16-map-retry.png`. A signed-in mobile E2E screenshot at `/tmp/marshgo-home-ukraine-date.png` confirms the reference-style home layout and Ukrainian date text. These runs do not perform OTP entry inside native iOS or authenticated native booking gestures. The latest Pro Max simulator build used `http://localhost:3002` with no API process running, so only first-screen rendering is verified there. The local toolchain was Node 25.4.0 while the project pins Node 24.21.0; the simulator build completed with an engine warning, and CI uses the pinned version.

## Native limitations and release work

* The current app relies on the existing browser session client. Validate refresh-cookie persistence across force-quit/relaunch on physical iOS devices before release.
* `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` describes foreground route use. Navigation requires `ROUTING_ENGINE_URL`; without it, starting a route returns an unavailable error. `VITE_MAP_TILE_URL` and attribution must point to a contracted or self-hosted tile service before street-map tiles appear.
* Background GPS is not supported or claimed. Push notifications, camera upload, App Store metadata/signing/privacy declarations, and physical-device GPS-permission testing remain separate work.
* No App Store archive, signing profile, public endpoint, production SMS, or external payment was created or used in simulator testing.
* This environment has the CoreSimulator runtime and `simctl` but does not include the graphical `Simulator.app`; `simctl` installed/launched the app and captured its production welcome screen, but interactive field entry and booking gestures could not be automated here.
* Site revision `3f000cd` tracks tile health per visible tile and adds a retry action for a degraded/failed map layer. The iOS Simulator Build workflow checks out the current `MarshGO-Site` main branch and compiles this revision into the native bundle. Street tiles still require an approved provider URL and attribution. E2E verifies a simulated partial tile outage and recovery on both Pro Max viewport sizes; this does not verify an actual contracted provider.

## Candidate-bound navigation proposal verification (2026-09-30)

Pulled `MarshGO-Site` revision `2cdc4a2`, rebuilt the Capacitor bundle, and built/installed/launched `ua.marshgo.app` on the iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator (`95861893-8B55-4A9C-B30D-C9BD1FCC4132`) and iPhone 16 Pro Max simulator (`316E0648-A5CF-4D53-8601-A87A9B5EB862`). Screenshots: `/tmp/marshgo-site2cdc4a2-iphone15.png` and `/tmp/marshgo-site2cdc4a2-iphone16.png`; both render the full welcome screen within the device safe areas. The simulator bundle was built with the local development URL `http://localhost:3306`, but no API process was running during this device check, so it verifies native packaging, installation, launch, and first-screen rendering only. It does not verify sign-in, authenticated marketplace flows, GPS, route tiles, map interactions, or navigation proposal gestures. The local Xcode build ran under Node 25.4.0 and reported the repository's expected Node 24.21.0 engine warning; CI remains pinned to Node 24.21.0.
